<h2>Photography</h2>
<p>I picked up photography as a means of decompressing and being more intentional about how I go through my day and how I choose to view scenes in everday life. Photagraphy forces me to try and see the best version, the full potential of things, people, and places that I otherwide wouldn't see.   </p>
